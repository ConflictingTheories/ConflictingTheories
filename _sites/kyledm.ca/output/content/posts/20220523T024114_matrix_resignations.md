# Matrix  ResignationsðŸ’€ðŸª¦

The most recent matrix movie is an affront to the series. I tried to watch it multiple times and I have yet to manage to stomach it through completion. The first movie is one of my favourite movies of all time, and I would say I have seen it close to 100 times at least. To say I am a fan of it is an understatement, and I can practically talk along with the entire movie. The second and third I have seen many times though not nearly as much - probably a few dozen times a piece. The second one is quite good and I really enjoyed it when it came out - not quite as good as the first, but it provided more depth and breadth to the world and allowed for the expansion of my favourite universe - so I was stoked. 

The fourth movie was a reboot, and it was originally something I was excited for. I had nostalgia pumping in my veins and I was ready to relive my favourite series with amped up effects, new stories, and what I was imagining to be a great continuation of the franchise by the original creators.....

Boy was I wrong. It's bad. ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤¢

This is one which is not fan service....it is pure dis-service. Disgusting...unoriginal tripe. Every fan story ever written is better...this entire movie should be scrapped, removed, and the only....really only saving out this movie may have is to imagine it is a figment of the machines before Neo is freed and its an attempt to thwart the morale of the crew...then...the first movie starts so it is completely irrelevant and rather than being some form of sequel...it instead takes on a faux-prequel. 

That may be just enough to manage to stomach it...but to take it at face value is insulting. Plain and simple. Just insulting. The entire movie is nothing more than a disgrace which should be seen as evidence that the Wachowski's were far superior as a pair back in the 90's than one of them today. Past their prime...is an understatement.

Avoid this movie if you are a fan. If you didn't like the original series at all - then by all means - enjoy the carrion.
