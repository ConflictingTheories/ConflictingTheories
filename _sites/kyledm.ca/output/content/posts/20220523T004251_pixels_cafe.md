I have always been a fan of video games and while I do not play as much as I once did, I have retained a sweet spot within my heart for them. Especially those which I grew up with.

The medium as a whole I find one of the greatest storytelling mediums human's have created yet. Books will probably forever remain the key milestone for even today most games are started with a book draft or script of some sort outlining the basic plot. That being said, I feel the art of video games to provide a vastly superior experience for interaction and for crafting a sense of immersion.

Whilst some of the characts within games do not necessarily all carry the depth of the literary greats such as _Great Expectation's_ principal protagnoist Pip, or that of Dagny Taggert from _Atlas Shrugged_ - they certainly allow the player to craft the characters motivations in ways they themselves see fit often.

To show my appreciation to all things pixelated (mostly video games, but I am not limiting myself at this time), I am starting a more dedicated niche blog called ["Pixels Cafe"](https://pixels.cafe) which you are welcome and gladly invited to check out.
