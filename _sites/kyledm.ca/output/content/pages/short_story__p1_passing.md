# The Passing

The sun was hot today. Normally, it wasn' like that at this time of the year, thought David as he walked along the sidewalk. It felt dry and overbearing and it was making him struggle to get a good breath in. The kind of heat that pushes into you and forces all the air out - stifling. 

Maybe it wasn't the sun. Maybe David was just feeling uncomfortable, he thought to himself. Why, it wasn't like he wanted to be out walking at this moment. He would much rather be in his apartment enjoying the cooling AC breeze from his 3rd-story corner suite. Sure, it was the back corner - and he didn't have much of a view, unless you counted a few bums having a sit and sharing a tale or too through the night. 

There was a week once last summer when someone had tossed away a half-dead tropical fern - it has sat there forlornly until the garbage truck came and took it to its new home - David had considered bringing it in and trying to coax it back to life. Something had stopped him. He hadn't really thought about it until this moment. I guess the heat had brought it - was it because it was tropical? I perhaps because it represented a chance thrown away...something he had a tendency of doing.

Snapping back to the state at hand, he stopped himself from barelling into a woman and her stroller and child coming around the corner. Smiling towards them, he ducked out of the way, and took a sharp turn round the bend - immediately running head-first into another gentleman - a rather portly fellow who stumbled back a bit.

"Why, you really should be more careful!" - the portly man blurted out in surprise after catching himself, "are you day dreaming, son?"

David, feeling a bit embarrassed but also a little perturbed (it takes two to collide after-all and he wasn't running), straightened himself and without appearing too flustered, managed to cough out a simple "apologies!" and continued on his way. Unfortunately, David couldn't afford to be polite and make many pleasantries today. He couldn't afford to be late - an important meeting was scheduled, and he needed to be on time.

David rushed along the street and continued hurriedly towards his destination.
