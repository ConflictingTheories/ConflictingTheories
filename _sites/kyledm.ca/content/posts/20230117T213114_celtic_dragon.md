In continuation from my last post, I have been fleshing out my vision for a new kind of interactive sprite skits aka Spritz - or to be more precise, I have decided to call them Pixospritz as the longer form. One it is a fun word to say, two it is not going to be accidentally confused with spritzer or spritz the drink, and it will connect with the original platform which started it - the Pixos engine.

Pixospritz are as previously mentioned - interactive sprite skits - which can either be fully enjoyed much like a film or more like a game as they find the happy medium between videos and games.

Being that they are fully scriptable and the assets can be customized quite thoroughly, it should allow for wide ranges of expression and allow for all sorts of creativity to take root.

For now I am finishing out some of the final features which I wish to include in the initial official release and with it I will likely setup a small community forum to share Pixospritz with others as well as see some demos. 

The website will most likely be https://spritzcast.com and I will likely make a separate site for the actual platform, documentation, and more - however that will depend on how much time I have available.

Until the next update, take care and stay tuned for the future of Pixospritz and digital storytelling.
