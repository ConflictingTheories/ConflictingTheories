# Peaceful Garden

To expand on my Pixos plugin, I have decided that a good way to showcase it is via a simple game. I have decided to make a small indie game of sorts called "Peaceful Garden" though calling it a game is a bit of stretch. The Pixos engine is not designed to be used to build power games, and certainly is not aiming for flexibility. Rather, it aims to provide a very straightforward and simple way of telling digital stories through 3D worlds.

Peaceful Garden will be a simple story which takes inspiration from the Choose-your-own-adventure novels and games. It will offer a simple procedurally generated world for the user to explore and discover hidden secrets amd small tidbits of lore scattered about. Actions the players take will affect the generator and provide unique experiences based on their decisions.

In addition to the simple CYOA framework, there will be some collectables and puzzles as well for the player to engage with. And finally, underpinning the whole experience will be small anecdotes, stories, and cutscenes which will play out in different areas of the games generated world. These will be partially random, partially conditional and in some cases pre-determined and directed.

My goal with the Peaceful Garden is a simple enjoyable experience that offers a taste of what the Pixos engine has to offer creators. You can follow along with the progress at [The Peaceful Garden's Website](https://peaceful.garden)
