This is a fan site for all things pixelated. Mostly games I really enjoyed growing up, or games which I have discovered more recently and wish to appreciate. This is mostly a site focused on video games, but from time to time some additional content will be added. Most of this additional content will be involving computer history, pop culture from 80's, 90's, or 00's and the related content.

I hope you enjoy this site and please take a <i style="color:orange">byte</i> & and stay for a <i style="color:orange">bit</i>.
