# Section 1 - Identifying the Problems

This section will focus on identifying some the problems inherent in the process of reclaiming your digital self.

- Plausible deniability
    - The ability to claim you do not know what the contents of something may be because you could not know how to access the information, or an alibi which allows you to avoid problems is very important. If you can maintain this - you will be very secure. However, if you cannot maintain this - you will likely be open to vulnerable exposure.
        - ex. Encrypted content which you dont have any keys associated to decrypt it

    
- Digital Fingerprinting
    - Even without explicit tracking methods - implicit and abstracted means can be used to identify you on the internet.
        - ex. Screen Size, Timezone, Frequency, Scroll Patterns, IP Addresses, Browser Type and useragent, searches, referral sites, cross-site cookies, phone-numbers, carrier networks, ISPs, etc...


- Payment Gateways
    - Visa and Mastercard and the major banks all control the flow of most official e-commerce. Having control over the payment gateways means that they can classify and code the 'types' of businesses which can operate. If you aren't one of these classes, you will not be allowed to do business. 
        - ex. Pharmacies, medicine, and gambling are all industries which are typically highly regulated - this means, that in order to operate they usually have to use high-risk payment processors - these are usually hosted in offshore countries which do not have strict financial laws - they are riskier because you do not typically know who is operating them.

- Unencrypted Web-Traffic / Sniffing
    - Wire sniffing and wifi-sniffing can pose a problem. This can be done at any portion of the network, but the amount information is typically masked at each layer. Firewalls typically mask quite a lot of traffic, behind the firewall you may have one or more subnets which then will have their own set of information in the routing - if a vulnerability is discovered and exploited within these layers, it can intercept replies as well as outgoing packets so end-to-end encryption is very important.


- Phishing Emails / Hacked Accounts
    - If you can restore access to your accounts from a number of ways - while you have a lower odds of being locked out, so too do other people have a means of getting access to everything. Usually the goal of a phishing email scam is not to gain access to one account - it is usually to then find a weakness within the entire structure of your digital self. If each account is managed separately you will not have to worry because while that account may be compromised, it will self-quarantine and not spread. Make sure you start to untangle your accounts from one another. It will take some time - and make sure YOU are keeping track, but don't patch the holes and then blow up the ship...


- Social Reputation
    - There are two kinds of digital reputations - Avatars and Handles. Avatars are typically designed to represent yourself (personal - physical self), whereas handles are used to identify online personalities. While both have their uses, make sure you are aware of which is which. If you can connect a handle to an avatar, you have an avatar. Handles are not tied to avatars - so be careful. You may have to remove your avatars. Its important to maintain some form of reputation in order to have value online, but you need to be aware of what can happen if your reputation does a 180...


- Creative vs Destructive Expression
    - Beware of creative expression vs destructive expression. They often come in the way of exploration but quickly take different routes. One will open opportunities for discussion, the other will remove them from discussion. If you find yourself in constant desctructive expression, it may be having an effect on your mental filters which you need online to properly consume content. Creative expression will ask open questions or voluntary advice - destructive expression will make demands and try to narrow the focus of discussion. Companies design products and services to do the same thing. All tools claim to make your life better, but some choose destructive means and others choose creative means.
        - ex. Google Wifi is a destructive expression of managing wifi. It removes options that can be found traditionally in favour of providing a very tailored expreience to mask its dark tracking patterns.
