# Enough is Enough

We cannot just stand idly by while large platforms decide the fate of our economy, our autonomy, and the discourse that occurs online. We need to reclaim the internet to what it used to be about - creative expression and an open forum. At the beginning people embraced all these new platforms because they continued to embody a large part of the original thought and spirit of the internet, but over time as they have grown far larger than any prior platform thay have begun to erode those values.

While much of the content they moderate can rightfully be said to be in need of it - such as illicit material - anything which does not fall under that sort of label should in practice be open and free. In order to do this however, we can no longer depend on these large platforms to uphold these values as has been shown by their recent behaviour towards certain political leanings. Instead we should hold them accountable and where possible detach some our dependence from them and regain a little more freedom on the web.

This isn't necessarily without its costs however, and in doing so there is a high likelihood that some things will have to be forgone or changed drastically to adopt a whole seperation, so it is unlikely that this guide can help with a complete detachment. But it can serve a guide to help start your journey and perhap show you some of the tools that are currently available to help transition off these platforms.

## Sovereignty? What does that mean?

Sovereignty in this context refers to the liberation and reclaimation of your digital self. Having control and retaining your voice. It is not about flouting laws willy-nilly or anything of a nature against any state - more-so it is about making the statement to embrace your own individuality and find a peaceful way of expression - free from the opinions and censors of those who may feel differently and be in a position of authority to censor.

The intention is that this guide empowers all people - not a select few and that is one principle it aims to hold by.

Thank you and enjoy.
