### Update as of March 2025:
- Past 4.5 years were mostly working for AgencyAnalytics via private git repos [https://github.com/agencyanalytics], so much of my activity from the past 4 years is not directly associated with this github account, and was done with a company specific account. 
- While employed, top 5 contributer - averaging each year approximately 200-250+ PRs / 500+ Code reviews / 1000's of commits during my time there
